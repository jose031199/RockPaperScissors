# RockPaperScissors
Project to build an easy rock,paper and scissors game

# Introduction:
We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. If you don’t know what that is check the Wikipedia article or this detailed step-by-step. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text, so don’t forget to keep the code on GitHub! You might notice some ‘Live Preview’ links in the student solutions that have a GUI - this is coming in a later lesson. When you get there don’t forget to come back and add your link! 

# PseudoCode:

3. Compare the user and computer choices
4. Whoever wins the round will get 1 point
